      "More than anything, Magnusson’s new book is about cherishing your relationships and allowing yourself pleasure – until your last breath. A philosophy as good as any, and she writes in high spirits and with playfulness, which resolutely removes any danger of her coming across as prudent … Margareta Magnusson is someone who goes against the grain. And loves doing it. I find this comforting and inspiring, anticipating my own presumed old age.",
